# Elm JWT Node example

## Installation

Clone this repo into a new project folder and run install script.
(I ignore the errors about missing jquery as it is best not to use the Bootstrap jquery-based components with Elm)

With npm

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run server
<in another window>
$ npm run dev
```

With yarn
```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn server
<in another window>
$ yarn dev
 ```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start modifying the code in /src.
(An example using Routing is provided in the `navigation` branch)
